# About
This repo contains an experimental GBC emulator written in Rust. The goal of this project is to provide a cross-platform (including web-based) emulator written in pure Rust that implements somewhat uncommon features in most emulators. Some of these features are:
 - Better synchronization of save data between your clients
 - Link cable support for seperate emulator instances
   - Ideally, this works on the machine machine, on the local network, and (potentially) over the internet

# Disclaimer
Construction of this emulator is just starting. It remains unclear how much of
the above scope is feasible.
